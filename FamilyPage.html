Amyyer is 26 years old this year and she was born in year 1995 ,on 30th April.She was born in  at Hospital Mukah because our parents only moved to Miri in 1995 after my sister was born.Amy was also studying in SK Sayed Othman and SMK St Columba.Her UPSR is 4A1B,while her PMR is 6A and 2B last but not least her SPM was 4A3B1C.My sister graduated from Universiti Teknologi Malaysia,Kota Samarahan with Diploma In Tourism Management and Bachelor Degree in Finance.Earlier 2020,she works as a bank employee in Amanah Saham Nasional Berhad for couple of weeks.After that ,she started her own business with business capital RM200.She start off with affiliate program of Neelofa X Mamasab by becoming the collaboration dropship.After that,she join the Unicorm Team Of Faith Fleur to increase her income.As her small business becoming more stable,she join the BeauBoss Team who sold Beautyra products such as blusher,lipstick,hair to toe mist .For faith fleur ,she sold hair products such as shampoo,conditioner,hair serum,hair mist and hair tonic.She`s doing all sort of business to have her own income to support herself . She is actually still looking for job but after 2 years,she`s still haven`t found a job yet.Even though she`s not working ,but since she has her own business and still trying harder to get income for herself, I am really proud of her because she has the courage to step out from her zone and get stronger day by day.This day,the competition of small businesses is quiet intense since everyone is affected as the result of covid-19.Here I am still supporting her back even though I am far away from her.I bought her beautyra products too.One thing that I feared my sister is that she is an independant women.I am afraid that she might end up being single cause having a partner or a relationship was never even appeared in her life or even her mind.Her priority is on herself and her happiness along with her family. </font>
