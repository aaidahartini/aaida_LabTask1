                                As for my future,actually I did not have any clear future plans since I entered Politeknik.Before , I`ve dream to become a Psychologist since age of 15 years old.I would love to help those people who suffer from mental illness and mental disorder.But yet my abilities and efforts are not eneough for me to achieve my dream.After I persue my study in Politeknik,at first I am not interested in Information Technology at all but after I had finished my first semester I started to show interest in my courses.After I learnt C++ programming language during my second semester,I realized that coding is like an art.Same like you colour your drawing book when you are little.Even though I am not that good in any classes that we need to do coding.I feel like I am still learning how to draw whenever I do my coding.It felt like I am improving my drawing day by day whenever I learn something from my coding classs.Now that I am here growing interest in Software Development,I decided to persue my study in Information Technology Courses later on after I finish my Diploma.During the time I am thinking about my future,i decided to choose either <a href="https://www.unimas.my/"> Unimas </a>  and <a href="https://ums.edu.my/v5/"> UMS </a> for my University Choice to persue my Bachelor Degree since there are some Information Technology Courses there that I am interested.Despite being interested in Software Development lately,I am still thinking whether I want to pursue my degree in IT or take another courses that not related to IT.Future is future.I am still following my own flow of life

                                Since I am not confirm which flaw I will want to go through,I did not predict any career plan that I would loves to do in future.If I manage to graduated from univesities in Bachelor Degree In Software Engineering ,I would loves to be an Application Developer or Cyber Security Analyst or Web Designer or Information System Manager or Web Developer or even Multimedia Programmer.As for my personal life,I had a dream to have a supportive partner who accept me the way I am for the rest of my life,but then,my career and study is still my priority in the next 10 years.And I want to take car license and buy Mazda Car.
